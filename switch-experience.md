# Switching between {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} and the classic experience
{: #switch-experience}

You can easily switch back and forth between {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} and the classic experience. However, {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} provides a simplified user interface, an improved deployment process, and access to the latest features. For more information, see [Migrating to {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}}](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-migrate-overview).

To switch between the new and classic experiences, following these steps:

1. From the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} interface, click the **Manage** ![Manage icon](images/user--avatar.svg) icon to open your account menu.

1. Select **Switch to classic experience** or **Switch to new experience** from the account menu.

You won't lose any work if you switch to a different experience, and other users of the same instance are not affected. However, keep in mind that any work you do in one experience is not available in the other experience. You can switch back and forth at any time.
