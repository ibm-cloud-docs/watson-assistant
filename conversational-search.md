# Conversational search
{: #conversational-search}

[Plus]{: tag-green} [Enterprise]{: tag-purple}

Use *conversational search* with the {{site.data.keyword.discoveryfull}} search integration or Elasticsearch search integration to help your assistant extract an answer from the highest-ranked query results and return a text response to the user.

When you enable this feature, search results are provided to an IBM watsonx generative AI model that produces a conversational reply to a user's question.

To use conversational search, you must have a Plus or Enterprise plan.
