# Using watsonx.ai for generative AI capabilities
{: using-watsonxai-for-generative-ai-capabilities}

[Beta]{: tag-cyan}

By enabling watsonx.ai, you bring the generative AI capabilities in your assistants to give quick, accurate, and intelligent responses to the customer queries. In addition, the Large Language Models (LLMs) help your assistant to recognize customer conversation and respond to queries by using clear and concise conversation. 

This beta feature is available in English for evaluation and testing purposes only. The watsonx generative AI model is currently hosted only in the Dallas and Frankfurt regions. To sign up for the beta access for Information Gathering, use the form [here](https://forms.monday.com/forms/5d57f5429e099cfe24462c277efdd058?r=use1){: external}. To sign up for beta access to Conversational Search, use the form [here](https://wkf.ms/4bKDCUh){: external}.{: beta}

By default, assistants in all regions except `Frankfurt` use the model from the `Dallas` region. {: important}
