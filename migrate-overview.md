# Migrating to the new experience
{: #migrate-overview}

If you are using an older product instance, you might still be using the classic {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} experience. To take advantage of the latest features, consider switching to the new experience.
{: shortdesc}

You can freely switch which experience you see without losing any of your work or affecting other users of the instance.

For more information about how to switch between the classic experience and the new experience, see [Switching the experience](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-welcome-new-assistant#welcome-new-assistant-switch-experience).

Consider the following questions to decide which experience you want to use:

Do you want to build a new actions-based assistant?
:    The new experience provides a simplified user interface that was designed around actions, as well as an improved [deployment process](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-publish-overview). If you plan to build an actions-based assistant, use the new experience for access to the latest features and improvements.

Are you working on an existing assistant built in the classic {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}}?
:    If you have a dialog-based assistant that was built using the classic {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}}, and you are not currently planning to migrate to an actions-based assistant, you might still want to consider migrating it to the new experience so you can take advantage of the new process for publishing and deploying your assistant. Migrating to the new experience also makes it easy for you to begin using actions when you are ready.

    For more information about how to migrate a dialog-based assistant to the new experience, see [Activating dialog and migrating skills](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-activate-dialog).

Do you want to convert an existing dialog-based assistant to use actions?
:    If you have a dialog-based assistant, but you want to reimplement it to use actions instead, start by migrating it to the new experience. You can then start using actions alongside your dialog, and you can replace your dialog nodes with actions at your own pace.

    For more information about using a dialog with actions, see [Calling actions from a dialog](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-dialog-call-action).
