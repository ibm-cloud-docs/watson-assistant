# Migrating to {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}}
{: #migrate-overview}

If you are using an older product instance, you might still be using the classic experience. To take advantage of the latest features, consider switching to {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}}.
{: shortdesc}

You can freely switch which experience you see without losing any of your work or affecting other users of the instance.

For more information about how to switch between the classic experience and {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}}, see [Switching between {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} and the classic experience](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-welcome-new-assistant#welcome-new-assistant-switch-experience).

Consider the following questions to decide which experience you want to use:

Do you want to build a new actions-based assistant?
:    {{site.data.keyword.conversationfull}} provides a simplified user interface that was designed around actions, as well as an improved [deployment process](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-publish-overview). If you plan to build an actions-based assistant, use {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} for access to the latest features and improvements.

Are you working on an existing assistant built in the classic experience?
:    If you have a dialog-based assistant that was built using the classic experience, and you are not currently planning to migrate to an actions-based assistant, you might still want to consider migrating it to {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} so you can take advantage of the new process for publishing and deploying your assistant. Migrating to {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} also makes it easy for you to begin using actions when you are ready.

    For more information about how to migrate a dialog-based assistant to {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}}, see [Activating dialog and migrating skills](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-activate-dialog).

Do you want to convert an existing dialog-based assistant to use actions?
:    If you have a dialog-based assistant, but you want to reimplement it to use actions instead, start by migrating it to {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}}. You can then start using actions alongside your dialog, and you can replace your dialog nodes with actions at your own pace.

    For more information about using a dialog with actions, see [Calling actions from a dialog](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-dialog-call-action).
