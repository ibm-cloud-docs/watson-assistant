{: #assistant-data-jul262023}
{: release-note}

{{site.data.keyword.assistant_classic_full}} Cartridge for {{site.data.keyword.icp4dfull}} Version 4.7.1 is available
:   {{site.data.keyword.assistant_classic_short}} for {{site.data.keyword.icp4dfull}} 4.7.1 is compatible with {{site.data.keyword.icp4dfull}} Version 4.7. See the [support matrix](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-install-data#install-support-matrix) for more details. 

Edit step titles
:  You can now add and edit titles for each step, which can help you more easily identify what a step does in an action. For more information, see [Editing actions](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-build-actions-overview).

Filtering the list of actions
:   You can locate specific actions by filtering the list by subactions, by custom extension, or by variable. For more information, see [Filtering actions](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-filter-actions).

See which actions use a specific variable
:   The Variables page now includes a new *Actions count* column. You can click on the number in the column to see which actions use a variable. For more information, see [Creating a session variable](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-manage-info#create-session-variable).

New expression choice for setting a session variable
:   Previously, to use an expression to set or modify a variable value, you needed to pick an existing variable or create a new one and select the expression option. Now you can use a new **Expression** choice to write an expression directly without first picking a variable. For more information, see [Storing a value in a session variable](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-manage-info#store-session-variable).

Changes to validation of OpenAPI specifications 
:   When you build a custom extension, you work with OpenAPI specification files. This release includes changes to the validation of OpenAPI files, which might affect the connection between your actions and extensions 

   You can import an action with references to a custom extension and {{site.data.keyword.assistant_classic_short}} can automatically connect the action and extension. With the validation change, modifications to the OpenAPI specification for your custom extension might affect this automatic connection. For more information, see [Building a custom extension](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-build-custom-extension).

Changes to the date and number formats in assistant responses
:   You might see changes to the date and number formats in assistant responses.

   Examples of date changes include removed or added periods, such as:
   -  In Spanish, `18 abr. 2021` changes to `18 abr 2021`
   -  In Portuguese, `18 de abr` changes to `18 de abr.`

   The delimiter character changes for numbers in some languages. For example, in French, nonbreaking space (NBSP) changes to narrow no-break space (NNBSP).

   These changes are the result of migrating the {{site.data.keyword.assistant_classic_short}} platform to Java 17, where locale values are updated by using specifications in [CLDR 39](https://cldr.unicode.org/downloads/cldr-39){: external}. 
   
   To avoid or minimize the impact of similar changes in the future, you can use [Display formats](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-actions-global-settings#actions-global-settings-display-formats).

Differences in contextual entity detection for dialog skills with few annotations
:   If you have 10 to 20 examples of contextual entities in your dialog skill, you might see differences in the entities detected due to updates made to address critical vulnerabilities. The impact of these differences is limited to only newly-trained models. Existing models are unaffected. You can mitigate these differences by annotating more examples. For more information, see [Annotation-based method](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-entities#entities-annotations-overview).

For details, see [Customizing validation for a response](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-handle-errors#customize-validation).

Confirmation to return to previous action
:   If a customer changes to a different topic, assistants now ask a "yes or no" confirmation question to determine whether the customer wants to return to the previous action. Previously, the assistant returned to the previous action without asking. New assistants are set to use this confirmation by default. For details, see [Confirmation to return to previous topic](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-change-topic#change-topic-confirmation).

New "Never return" choice for when a customer changes topics
:   In some cases, you might not want a customer to return to a previous action after the customer changes the topic. To set up this option, use the new Never return choice in Action settings. For details, see [Disabling returning to the original topic](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-change-topic#change-topic-never-return).

Allow changing topics in free text and regex responses
:   By default, customers can't change topics when the assistant is asking for a free text response or when an utterance matches the pattern in a regex response. Now free text and regex customer response types have a setting to allow a customer to digress and change topics. For details, see [Enabling changing the topic for free text and regex customer responses](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-change-topic#change-topic-free-text-regex).

You can build content in the draft environment and test versions of your content in the extra environments. For details, see [Adding and using multiple environments](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-multiple-environments).

Display formats for variables
:   In the Global settings page for actions, you can use the Display formats tab to specify the display formats for variables that use date, time, numbers, currency, or percentages. You can also choose a default locale to ensure that the format of a variable that's displayed in the web chat is what you want for your assistant. For example, you can choose to have the output of a time variable appear in HH:MM format instead of HH:MM:SS. For details, see [Display formats](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-actions-global-settings#actions-global-settings-display-formats).

Debug custom extensions
:   You can use the new extension inspector in the action editor Preview pane to debug problems with custom extensions. The extension inspector shows detailed information about what data is being sent to and returned from an external API. For details, see [Debugging failures](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-call-extension#extension-debug).

New expression choice for setting a session variable
:   Previously, to use an expression to set or modify a variable value, you needed to pick an existing variable or create a new one and select the expression option. Now you can use a new Expression choice to write an expression directly without first picking a variable. For details, see [Storing a value in a session variable](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-manage-info#store-session-variable).

Using the Cloud Object Storage importer to migrate chat logs
:   You can use the Cloud Object Storage importer service to migrate your chat logs from one installation of {{site.data.keyword.assistant_classic_short}} to another.For more information, see [Using the Cloud Object Storage importer to migrate chat logs](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-cos-importer-data).

{{site.data.keyword.assistant_classic_full}} Cartridge for {{site.data.keyword.icp4dfull}} Version 4.6.5 is available
:   {{site.data.keyword.assistant_classic_short}} for {{site.data.keyword.icp4dfull}} 4.6.5 is compatible with {{site.data.keyword.icp4dfull}} Version 4.6. See the [support matrix](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-install-data#install-support-matrix) for more details. This release of {{site.data.keyword.assistant_classic_short}} for {{site.data.keyword.icp4dfull}} includes various fixes and features.

Algorithm version 01-Jun-2022 uses enhanced intent detection by default
:   The algorithm version **Latest (01-Jun-2022)** now uses enhanced intent detection by default. Before this change, some skills that did not include a specific algorithm version selection inadvertently used **Previous (01-Jan-2022)**. You can notice small changes in intent detection behavior when changes are made to an assistant that previously didn't have enhanced intent detection enabled. For more information, see [Algorithm version and training](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-algorithm-version).

Test the **Beta** algorithm version now to prepare for release 4.7.0
:   The **Beta** algorithm version in release 4.6.5 includes a new irrelevance detection implementation to improve off-topic detection accuracy.

   Improvements include:
   - Relevant user inputs are expected to get higher confidence, so they are less likely to be considered irrelevant or require clarification
   - Irrelevance detection is improved in the presence of direct entity references
   - Irrelevance detection is more stable across small changes to input
   - Intent detection is more stable regarding occurrence of numerics, such as postal codes
   - For German-language assistants, intent detection is more robust in the presence of umlauts 

   In the forthcoming 4.7.0 release, it is planned that this **Beta** version will become the **Latest** version, replacing the current **Latest (01 Jun 2022)** version. You can test the **Beta** version in 4.6.5 now to prepare.

Language support improvements
:   Entity recognition and intent classification for Japanese and Korean languages changed to improve the reliability of {{site.data.keyword.assistant_classic_short}}. You might see minor differences in how {{site.data.keyword.assistant_classic_short}} handles entity recognition and intent classification.

   Any visible changes are most likely to be seen in dictionary-based or pattern-based entity matching. For more information about defining entities, see [Adding entities](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-entities). As a suggested practice, you can test your dialog skill with your current test framework to determine whether your workspace is impacted before you update your production workspace.

   If entity values or synonyms that previously matched no longer match, you can update the entity and add a synonym with white space between the tokens, for example:
   - Japanese: Add “見 た” as a synonym for “見た”
   - Korean: Add “잘 자 요” as a synonym for “잘자요”

Assistant preview link can be disabled
:   Assistant preview now includes a toggle to disable the preview link. This allows you to stop access to the preview link if necessary.

{{site.data.keyword.assistant_classic_full}} Cartridge for {{site.data.keyword.icp4dfull}} 4.0.8 is available
:   {{site.data.keyword.assistant_classic_short}} for {{site.data.keyword.icp4dfull}} 4.0.8 is compatible with {{site.data.keyword.icp4dfull}} 4.0 on Red Hat OpenShift 4.8. This release of {{site.data.keyword.assistant_classic_short}} for {{site.data.keyword.icp4dfull}} includes various fixes and features.

Closed entity matching with accent-normalized values in French
:   Closed entities exact matches in French are completed using accent-normalized values or synonyms. For example, if you define a closed entity with a value or synonym with accent marks (for example, garçon or déjà), then variants without accent marks are also recognized (garcon or deja). Likewise, if a closed entity value or synonym is defined without accent marks, then user inputs with accent marks are also recognized. For more information about defining entities, see [Defining information to look for in customer input](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-entities).

Pattern entities do not prevent spelling autocorrection
:   Pattern entities that match all characters and words that are usually used to count input words do not prevent spelling autocorrection. For example, if a customer defines the `^..{0,19}$` pattern entity that matches the first 20 characters of an input, then the entity match does not affect spelling autocorrection. In this example, an input of `cancl transaction` is autocorrected to `cancel transaction`.

   This change applies to the following languages: English and French. For more information, see [Autocorrecting user input](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-autocorrection).

Fuzzy matching updates
:   Previously, an update was made so that interactions between the stemming and misspelling fuzzy matching features were not allowed. This change applied to the following languages: English, French, German, and Czech. This was updated so that this change applies only to the English language. For more information, see [How fuzzy matching works](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-entities#entities-fuzzy-matching).

Improved irrelevance detection for Dutch
:   Irrelevance detection for Dutch disregards any punctuation in an input sentence. For example, you can now expect the same confidence score for the following two inputs: `ik ben een kleine krijger?` and `ik ben een kleine krijger`. In this example, the question mark (`?`) doesn't affect the confidence score.

Improved enhanced intent detection
:   The exact match in enhanced intent detection now better handles small differences between training examples and runtime utterances when the differences do not change the meaning of a sentence.

   For example, suppose in your training examples, `covid-19` is in the `#covid` intent and `@doctortype_facilitytype around Palm Beach` is in the `#find_provide_master` intent. In this example, the `@doctortype_facilitytype` direct entity reference contains entity values, including `hospital`. At run time, `covid19` is predicted as 100% confident for the `#covid` intent, and `hospital around palm beach` is predicted as 100% confident for the `#find_provide_master` intent.

   This update applies to the following languages: English, French, Spanish, Italian, and the universal language model. For more information, see [Accessing intents](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-expression-language#expression-language-intent).

This release of {{site.data.keyword.assistant_classic_short}} for {{site.data.keyword.icp4dfull}} includes various fixes and features.

Enhanced irrelevance detection update
:   We revised the enhanced irrelevance detection classification algorithm. Now, enhanced irrelevant detection uses any provided counterexamples in training. This change does not affect workspaces without counterexamples. This update applies to the following languages: English, French, Spanish, Italian, and the universal language model. For more information, see [Defining what's irrelevant](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-irrelevance-detection).

Fuzzy matching updates
:   Interactions between the stemming and misspelling fuzzy matching features are not allowed. Improve fuzzy matching behavior by limiting the interactions between different fuzzy matching features. This change applies to the following languages: English, French, German, and Czech. For more information, see [How fuzzy matching works](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-entities#entities-fuzzy-matching).

This release of {{site.data.keyword.assistant_classic_short}} for {{site.data.keyword.icp4dfull}} includes various fixes and features.

New API version
:   The current API version is now `2021-11-27`. This version introduces the following changes:

    - The `output.text` object is no longer returned in `message` responses. All responses, including text responses, are returned only in the `output.generic` array.

Configure webhook timeout
:   From the **Pre-message webhook** and **Post-message webhook** configuration pages, you can configure the webhook timeout length from a minimum of 1 second to a maximum of 30 seconds. For more information, see [Webhook overview](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-webhook-overview).

Rich response types
:   Your assistant can now send responses that include elements such as audio, video, or embedded `iframe` content. For more information, see [Rich responses](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-dialog-overview#dialog-overview-multimedia).

Analytics overview change
:   To improve reliability, the **Values** column has been removed from **Top entities** on the **Analytics Overview** page. **Top Entities** continues to provide counts of entity types. For more information, see [Top intents and top entities](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-logs-overview#logs-overview-tops).

Dialog skill **Try it out** improvements
:   For dialog skills, the **Try it out** pane now uses the [React](https://react.dev/){: external} UI framework similar to the rest of the {{site.data.keyword.assistant_classic_short}} user interface. You shouldn't see any change in behavior or functionality. As a part of the update, dialog skill error handling has been improved within the **Try it out** pane.

Disambiguation feature updates
:   The dialog skill disambiguation feature now includes improved features:

    - **Increased control**: The frequency and depth of disambiguation can now be controlled by using the **sensitivity** parameter in the [workspace API](/apidocs/assistant-v1?code=node#updateworkspace){: external}. There are 5 levels of sensitivity:
        - `high`
        - `medium_high`
        - `medium`
        - `medium_low`
        - `low`

        The default (`auto`) is `medium_high` if this option is not set.

    - **More predictable**: The new disambiguation feature is more stable and predictable. The choices shown may sometimes vary slightly to enable learning and analytics, but the order and depth of disambiguation is largely stable.

    These new features may affect various metrics, such as disambiguation rate and click rates, as well as influence conversation-level key performance indicators such as containment.

    If the new disambiguation algorithm works differently than expected for your assistant, you can adjust it using the sensitivity parameter in the update workspace API. For more information, see [Update workspace](/apidocs/assistant-v1?code=node#updateworkspace){: external}.

Access conversation logs and metrics
:   An **Analytics** page is now available. From this page, you can see conversation logs and metrics that give you insights, such as what topics your customers are asking about and how often the assistant succeeds in addressing customer requests. For more information, see [Metrics overview](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-logs-overview).

Introducing the *Web chat* integration
:   Deploy your assistant in minutes. Create a web chat integration to embed your assistant into a page on your website as a chat widget. Web chat version 3.3.0 is included in this release.

Introducing the *Preview link* integration
:   Deploy your assistant to an IBM-branded web site for testing purposes. When you add both a dialog skill and search skill to your assistant, you can test the overall interaction between the two skills by using the preview link integration. 

Improved system entities
:   A new `interpretation` property is returned for the system entities in all languages. The new property provides additional information about the recognized entity which can be leveraged by your dialog. For more information, see [System entities](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-system-entities).

Irrelevance detection
:   The irrelevance detection classification algorithm was updated to make it even smarter out of the box.

{: release-note}

{{site.data.keyword.assistant_classic_full}} for {{site.data.keyword.icp4dfull}} 1.4.2 is available
:   {{site.data.keyword.assistant_classic_short}} for {{site.data.keyword.icp4dfull}} 1.4.2 is compatible with {{site.data.keyword.icp4dfull}} 3.0.1 on OpenShift Red Hat 3.11 or 4.5 and {{site.data.keyword.icp4dfull}} 2.5 deployments on OpenShift Red Hat 3.11. The 1.4.2 release is certified on Red Hat OpenShift 4.5.

Autocorrection support was added
:   Autocorrection helps your assistant understand what your customers want. It corrects misspellings in the input that customers submit before the input is evaluated. With more precise input, your assistant can more easily recognize entity mentions and understand the customer's intent. This feature is not available in all languages. See [Autocorrecting user input](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-autocorrection) for details.

French-language dialog skill improvements
:   Added full support for fuzzy matching and contextual entities and added beta support for autocorrection.

The Covid-19 content catalog is available in Brazilian Portuguese, English, French, and Spanish
:   The content catalog defines a group of intents that recognize the common types of questions people ask about the novel coronavirus. You can use the catalog to jump-start development of chatbots that can answer questions about the virus and help to minimize the anxiety and misinformation associated with it. For more information about how to add a content catalog to your skill, see [Using content catalogs](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-catalog).

Backup automation
:   Support was added for doing data backups on a schedule.

Stateless v2 message API
:   The v2 runtime API now supports a new stateless `message` method. For more information, see the [API Reference](/apidocs/assistant-data-v2#message-stateless)}.

Architecture improvements
:   The Skill-conversation microservice was removed. The microservice used to convert v2 API calls to v1 format and the other way around. The conversion is now done within the Store microservice. Reimplementing this function in the Store increased the overall speed with which v2 API requests are processed. The Spellchecker and CLU Embedding microservices were added. The word embeddings that are used by the language understanding pipeline (training, TAS, ED-MM) now are stored in the CLU Embedding microservice instead of MongoDB.

Slot prompt JSON editor
:   You can now use the context or JSON editors for the slot response field where you define the question that your assistant asks to get information it needs from the customer. For more information about slots, see [Gathering information with slots](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-dialog-slots).

Bug fixes
:   Multiple bug fixes were made.

Features not included
:   This release does not include the following features, which are available for cloud instances at the time of this release:
   - There are no metrics or analytics capabilities. Therefore, the *Analytics* page is not included in the product user interface.
   - There are no deployment connectors or built-in integrations available. You must build a custom client application that can host the assistant. As a result, the *Integrations* page is not included in the product user interface.
   - The @sys-person and @sys-location system entities are not supported and the new version of the numeric system entities is not available.
   - There is no search function in the pages of the product.
