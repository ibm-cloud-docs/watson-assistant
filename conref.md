## LLM description table
{: #llm-description-table-reuse}

The following table shows the list of LLMs supported by the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}}.

| LLM model | Description |
| --------- | ----------- | 
| [`ibm/granite-3-8b-instruct`](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/wx/samples/models/ibm/granite-3-8b-instruct){: external} | Granite-3.0-8B-Instruct is a 8B parameter model finetuned from Granite-3.0-8B-Base using a combination of open source instruction datasets with permissive license and internally collected synthetic datasets. The model is designed to respond to general instructions and can be used to build assistants for multiple domains, including bussiness applications. |
| [`ibm/granite-3-2b-instruct`](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/wx/samples/models/ibm/granite-3-2b-instruct){: external} | Granite-3.0-2B-Instruct is a lightweight and open-source 2B parameter model fine tuned from Granite-3.0-2B-Base on a combination of open-source and proprietary instruction data with permissive license. The model is designed to respond to general instructions and can be used to build assistants for multiple domains, including business applications. |
