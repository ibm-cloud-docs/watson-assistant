# Deprecated and withdrawn models

The {{site.data.keyword.conversationfull}} product is evolving continuously and as technology improves, some foundation models get deprecated or withdrawn from support. Each model contains the reference for its **Model card** where you can get more information about technical specifications of the model.

## Deprecated foundation models
{: #deprecated-foundation-models}

[Deprecated]{: tag-deprecated}

The "Deprecated" tag indicates that the foundation model is deprecated. You can continue using the deprecated foundation model, but you might receive a notification in the UI about the upcoming model removal.

See the following table for the complete information about the deprecated models and a guidance to the next recommended model:

| Foundaton model name | Model card | Deprecated | Next recommended model |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| granite-13b-chat-v2 | ibm/granite-13b-chat-v2 | November 2024 | granite-3-8b-instruct |
{: caption="Foundation models that are deprecated." caption-side="bottom"}

## Withdrawn foundation models
{: #withdrawn-foundation-models}

[Withdrawn]{: tag-cool-gray}

The "Withdrawn" tag indicates that the support to a foundation model is withdrawn, and the product moves you to the most recent version of the same model family.

See the following table for the complete information about the withdrawn models and a guidance to the next recommended model:

| Foundation model name | Model card | Withdrawn | Next recommended model |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
