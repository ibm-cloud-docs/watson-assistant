# Building actions from templates
{: #actions-templates}

When you create actions, you can choose a template that relates to the problem youâ€™re trying to solve. Templates help tailor your actions to include items specific to your business need. The examples in each template can also help you to learn how actions work.
{: shortdesc}

Templates are available for different use cases, for example, booking a meeting, creating a support ticket, or making a payment. Templates include all the pieces that make up an action, such as steps, conditions, and different response types to collect customer answers.

You can use templates in English-language assistants only.
{: note}

Some or all of these features are included as examples in action templates:

| Feature | Description | More information |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Step conditions | A step condition is a Boolean test, based on a runtime value. The step is used only if the test evaluates as true. | [Adding conditions to a step](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-step-conditions) |
| Options synonyms | Synonyms are variations of an option value that customers might enter. | [Options](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-collect-info#customer-response-type-options) |
| Customized response validation | When you edit a step that expects a customer response, you can customize how validation errors are handled. | [When your customer gives invalid answers](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-handle-errors#step-validation)
| Action variables | When customers reply to your assistant, they share information about themselves and what they want. Your assistant remembers this information, and other information about a conversation, as variables. | [Using variables to manage conversation information](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-manage-info) |
| Session variables | A value that is not necessarily tied to a particular action can be stored as a session variable. Session variables are long-term memory: they persist throughout the user's interaction with the assistant, and your assistant can reference them from any action. | [Using variables to manage conversation information](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-manage-info) |
| Regex response type | A regex response collects a text string that matches a pattern that is expressed as a regular expression. Use this response to capture a value that must conform to a particular pattern or format, such as an email address or telephone number. | [Regex](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-collect-info#customer-response-type-regex) |
 | Yes/No response type | A confirmation response presents customers with the choices of either Yes or No as buttons. | [Confirmation](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-collect-info#customer-response-type-confirmation) |
 | Connect to agent | If your assistant is integrated with one of the supported service desk systems, you can build in logic that transfers the conversation to a live agent when necessary. | [Connecting to a live agent](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-human-agent) |
 | Embedded video | Includes a video to display a how-to demonstration, promotional clip, or other video content. In the web chat, a video response renders as an embedded video player. | [Adding a Video response](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-respond#respond-add-video) |
 | Customer responses referenced in URLs | In your assistant's output, you can reference variables to personalize a URL link, including information specific to the customer such as account number or email address | [Adding and referencing variables](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-respond#respond-variables) |
 | Customized agent handoff information | If your assistant is integrated with one of the supported service desk systems, you can build in logic that transfers the conversation to a live agent when necessary. You can customize messages the assistant displays as part of the transfer | [Connecting to a live agent](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-human-agent) |

## Creating actions from templates
{: #actions-templates-create}

To create actions from templates:

1. Open the **Actions** page.

1. If you have no actions, choose **Create a new action**. If you already have some actions, choose **New action**.

1. On **Create an action**, choose **Quick start with templates**.

   ![Create an action](images/actions-templates-create.png){: caption="Create an action" caption-side="bottom"}

1. On **Quick start with templates**, click a template to read details about what it does. Or, you can click the checkbox to select the template right away.

   If you choose a starter kit template, these actions require you to add a custom extension before you add the actions from the starter kit. For more information, see [Starter kit extension setup](#actions-templates-extension-setup).
   {: important}

   ![Quick start with templates](images/actions-templates-quick-start-2.png){: caption="Quick start with templates" caption-side="bottom"}

1. Review the details of the template, then click **Select this template**.

   ![Template details](images/actions-templates-review-2.png){: caption="Template details" caption-side="bottom"}

1. Your list of selected templates includes all the ones that you chose. You can select as many templates as you want. If you change your mind, click the trash can icon to remove a template from the list.

   ![Selected templates](images/actions-templates-selected.png){: caption="Selected templates" caption-side="bottom"}

1. When you're ready, click **Add templates**.

1. In the actions editor, you can use a new action as-is, or modify it to fit your use case.

   ![New action](images/actions-templates-editor.png){: caption="New action" caption-side="bottom"}

You can create multiple actions from the same template. For example, if you used the **Book a meeting** template to create an action, you can choose that template again. If the first action is still named **Book a meeting**, the new action is added with the name **Book a meeting (1)**.
{: note}

## Preview actions
{: #actions-templates-preview}

Most action templates are complete. (Starter kit templates are marked with an asterisk and require setup.) You can try out an action right away even without making any changes. 

To preview the action that you created from a template:

1. In the actions editor, click **Preview**.

1. Try some of the example phrases from **Customer starts with** to see how the assistant responds.

   ![Preview](images/actions-templates-preview.png){: caption="Preview" caption-side="bottom"}


## Starter kit extension setup
{: #actions-templates-extension-setup}

Starter kit templates add actions that can use extensions to connect to data and systems outside of {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}}. To learn more about extensions in general, see [Build a custom extension](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-build-custom-extension).

It's important to add the extension to your assistant first, so the starter kit actions can detect the installed extension. Don't add the starter kit actions without adding the extension first.
