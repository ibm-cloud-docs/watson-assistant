# Web chat development tutorials
{: #web-chat-develop-tutorials}

The tutorials in this section provide detailed examples, including code snippets, showing customizations that you can implement using the web chat API.
{: shortdesc}

Each tutorial includes links to a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-toolkit/tree/master/integrations/webchat/examples/){: external} where you can download complete working code for the example. You can run this code to see the customization in action, adapt it for your own web chat implementation, or use it as a guide for similar customizations of your own.

The GitHub repository also includes additional tutorials and examples that have not yet been added to this documentation, so feel free to browse.
