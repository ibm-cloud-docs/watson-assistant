## 5.2.1 release, 27 August 2025
{: #assistant-hub-aug272025}
{: release-note}

**New features** 

Automate the clean up of zombie records by using the CLU scheduler
: When you create an assistant, the Conversational Language Understanding (CLU) scheduler logs a corresponding entry in its database. If the entry is not properly removed during a requested assistant deletion, the entry becomes a zombie record. The CLU cleanup scheduler identifies and cleans up the zombie records. For more information, see [Configuring CLU cleanup scheduler](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/software-hub/5.2.x?topic=administering-configuring-clu-cleanup-scheduler){: external}.
