# Hate, abuse, and profanity filter
{: #hap-filter}

You can use the hate, abuse, and profanity (HAP) filter to maintain an inclusive environment. This feature filters content to provide a positive online atmosphere and a safe community for your customers. 

By enabling HAP detection, you can create a more consistent and reliable user experience that safeguards against the rare instances where HAP content might be generated. 

## Enabling the HAP filter
{: #hap-filter-enable}

To enable the HAP filter:

1. Go to **Global settings** > **Generative AI** > **HAP filtering**
1. Click the toggle to turn it on.

The HAP filter applies to the following areas:

- Conversational search
- Content-grounded answering
- General-purpose answering
- AI-guided actions

Consider the following key points when you use the HAP filter:

**HAP detection**: If HAP is detected, the assistant provides a generic fallback response. For more information, see [Conversational search](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-conversational-search).

**Recommendation**: When HAP is on, it minimizes the risk of unintended or inappropriate responses.
