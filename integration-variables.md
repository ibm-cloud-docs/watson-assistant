# Integration variables
{: #expression-integration-variables}

By writing expressions, you can access integration variables, which are context variables that are specific to integrations (such as the web chat and phone integrations). All integration variables are contained in the `system_integrations` JSON object, which you can access using the following expression:

```text
${system_integrations}
```
{: codeblock}

The `system_integrations` object has the following structure:

```json
{
  "channel": {
    "name": "{channel_name}",
    "private": {
      "user": {
        "id": "{user_id}",
        "phone_number": "{phone_number}",
        "name": "{name}"
      }
    }
  },
  "chat": {...},
  "voice_telephony": {...},
  "text_messaging": {...},
  "whatsapp": {...},
  "slack": {...},
  "facebook": {...},
  "teams": {...}
}
```
{: codeblock}

## `channel`
{: #expression-integration-variables-channel}

Always included. This object contains general information about the channel that is being used to communicate with the assistant.

### Properties
{: #expression-integration-variables-channel-properties}

Properties contained in the `private` object are treated as private variables, which are not included in logs.
{: note}

| Name                                | Type   | Description |
|-------------------------------------|--------|-------------|

| `channel.private.user.id`           | String | The ID of the user who is interacting with the assistant through the channel. This ID is specific to the channel and might be different from the user ID {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} uses for billing purposes. For more information, see [Channel user IDs](#expression-integration-variables-channel-userid). |
| `channel.private.user.phone_number` | String | The phone number associated with the user. Set by the phone, SMS, and WhatsApp integrations. |
| `channel.private.user.name`         | String | The name of the user who is interacting with the assistant through the channel. Set by the Microsoft Teams integration. |

### Channel user ID
{: #expression-integration-variables-channel-userid}

The `channel.private.user.id` property, which is set by the channel integration, specifies a user ID for the customer that is specific to the channel. The source of this user ID depends on the channel:

| Channel  | Channel user ID |

    }
  }
}
```
{: codeblock}

### Example expressions
{: #expression-integration-variables-chat-example-expression}

- This expression tests whether the customer is using the Chrome browser:

    ```text
    ${system_integrations}.chat.browser_info.browser_name.equals("chrome")
    ```

    You might specify this expression as the value for a boolean session variable, which you could then use in a step condition. For example, if your website supports only Chrome, you could have a step conditioned on this variable being `false` and has the following output: `I see you aren't using the Chrome browser. Some features of our website work only on Chrome.`

- This expression tests whether the current page URL contains the string `payment.html`:

    ```text
    ${system_integrations}.chat.browser_info.page_url.contains("payment.html")
    ```

    You might use this expression in a step condition in order to avoid telling customers to navigate to a page they are already viewing. For example, in an action for paying a bill, you could have a step conditioned on this variable being `false` and has the following output: `First, click **Pay bill** to navigate to the bill payment page.`

## `voice_telephony`
{: #expression-integration-variables-phone}

Included only if the phone integration is in use.

The `voice_telephony` object contains both response and request properties. Request properties are values that are set by the phone integration and provide information about the call. Response properties are input values that you can modify in your actions to send logging data or to change configuration options for the call.

### Request properties (set by the phone integration)
{: #expression-integration-variables-phone-properties-request}

Properties contained in the `private` object are treated as private variables, which are not included in logs.
