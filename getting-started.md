# Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}}
{: #getting-started}

{{site.data.keyword.conversationfull}}, which focuses on **actions** to build customer conversations, is simple enough for *anyone* to build a virtual assistant. Building, testing, publishing, and analyzing your assistant are all done in one simple and intuitive interface.

- The new assistant **architecture** enables simple navigation to specific parts of your assistant.

- The **navigation** provides a workflow for building, previewing, publishing, and analyzing your assistant. 

- The assistant has its own **home page** with a task list to help you get started.

- Build conversations with **actions** that represent the tasks you want your assistant to help your customers with. Each action contains a series of steps that represent individual exchanges with a customer.

- **Publish** reviews and debugs your work in a draft environment before your assistant goes live to your customers.

- Use **analytics** to improve your assistant. Review which actions are being completed, determine whether your assistant understands and addresses customer needs, and identify ways to enhance your assistant's performance.
