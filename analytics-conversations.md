# Review customer conversations
{: #analytics-conversations}



## Choosing the environment and time period
{: #analytics-conversations-time-period}

To get started, choose the [environment](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-publish-overview#environments) and date range you want to analyze. All conversations reflect data based on the environment and the date range you select. When you change the environment or the date range, the conversations on the page update to reflect the new date range. You can also use **Refresh** ensure the latest data is shown.

## Filtering conversations
{: #analytics-conversations-filtering}

You can locate specific conversations by filtering the list of conversations. This lets you explore specific areas where your assistant might need improvement or updates to properly handle what your customers are asking about.



- **Keyword**: Search by session ID or for specific key terms, phrases, or words in the conversations. For more information about session IDs, see [session_id](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-admin-managing-plan#admin-managing-plan-no-userid).

- **Recognition**: Choose between recognized or unrecognized user questions or requests.
- **Search**: Choose between requests that initiated a search or requests that produced no search results.

If you search for a specific session ID, enclose your search in quotation marks to ensure you receive an exact match on the full ID with its numbers and hyphen characters, for example: `"9015ab9a-2e13-4627-ae33-4179b1125cb5"`.
